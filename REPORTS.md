Introduction to Class Diagram
A Class Diagram is a type of structural diagram used in the Unified Modelling Language [`UML`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) This type of diagram focuses on the visualization of objects (Classes) and the connections between them, such as Inheritance or Aggregation. The diagram represents the system's Classes, __`Attributes`__, and __`Methods`__, as well as the __`Relationships`__ that connect these objects to each other.
